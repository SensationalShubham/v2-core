│  ├── When trying to transfer ownership(from old admin to new one)

└── Given the caller is the admin
   ├── Given the admin(new) is the same as the current admin (actual)
   │   └── When the admin transfers ownership to a new admin
   │     ├── Then it should re-set the admin
   │     └── And the {TransferAdmin} event should be emitted
   └── Given the admin(new) is not the same as the current admin(actual)
      ├── And the admin(new) is the zero address (who deploys the contract)
      │  ├── Then it should set the admin to the zero address
      │  └── And it should emit a {TransferAdmin}
      └── And the admin is not the zero address
         ├── Then it sets the new admin
         └── And it should emit a {TransferAdmin} event and set the new admin
